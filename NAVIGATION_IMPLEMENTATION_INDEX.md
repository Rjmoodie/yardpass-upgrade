## 🔑 Key Concepts

### View Modes
| Mode | Tabs | Use Case | Device |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| **App View** | 3 core | Quick access | Mobile |
| **Full Dashboard** | 8 complete | Full features | Desktop |

### Tab Categories
- **Core Tabs**: Events, Messaging, Teams (always in App View)
- **Heavy Utilities**: Analytics, Campaigns, Wallet, Payouts, Sponsorship (Full Dashboard only)
- **Settings**: Org Settings (available in both, as button)

### State Persistence
- View mode → `localStorage('organizer.viewMode')`
- Active tab → `localStorage('organizer.lastTab.{orgId}')`
- Last org → `localStorage('organizer.lastOrgId')`
- Tab state → URL query param `?tab=events`

3. **Persistent Preferences**: User choices remembered across sessions
4. **Smart Defaults**: Automatic mode selection based on device
5. **Clear Affordances**: Visual cues for active states and interactions
6. **Touch-Friendly**: Minimum 90px touch targets
7. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to all screen sizes
8. **Performance**: Lazy loading and conditional rendering
