const navItems = [
  { id: 'feed', path: '/', icon: Home },
  { id: 'search', path: '/search-new', icon: Search }, // Changed
  { id: 'tickets', path: '/tickets-new', icon: Ticket }, // Changed
  { id: 'profile', path: '/profile-new', icon: User }, // Changed
];
```

Or create a toggle in user settings to choose between old/new designs.

## 🔧 DEPENDENCIES REQUIRED

Make sure these packages are installed:

```bash
npm install qrcode
npm install --save-dev @types/qrcode
```

Already have:
- ✅ `@supabase/supabase-js`
- ✅ `react-router-dom`
- ✅ `lucide-react`
- ✅ `tailwindcss`

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1. **Messages Real-time** - Needs Supabase subscription setup
2. **Notifications Read State** - Needs `notifications` table or update logic
3. **Saved Events Table** - May need creation if doesn't exist
4. **QR Code Library** - Need to install `qrcode` package

---
