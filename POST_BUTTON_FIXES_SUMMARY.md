# Post Button Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

1. **Redundant Create Post Buttons Removed**:
   - ✅ Removed the create post button from the side action rail (right side vertical buttons)
   - ✅ Removed the redundant create post button from the top header area
   - ✅ Kept the primary create post button in the main action rail (the centered circular button with orange background)

2. **Fixed Organizer Posting Functionality**:
   - ✅ Updated `PostCreator` component to fetch events where user is an organizer
   - ✅ Added support for organization membership-based event access
   - ✅ Users who are organizers can now post to events they organize, not just events they have tickets for
   - ✅ Updated the event selection placeholder text from "Select an event you're attending" to "Select an event to post to"

## Technical Changes Made

### 1. Button Removal (src/pages/Index.tsx)
- Removed the `Plus` icon button from the right-side action rail
- Removed the "Create Post" button from the top header area
- Kept the main circular create post button in the center action rail

### 2. Organizer Posting Logic (src/components/PostCreator.tsx)
- **Enhanced User Ticket Fetching**: Modified the `useEffect` that fetches user events to include:
  - Events where user has tickets (existing functionality)
  - Events where user is the direct creator (`created_by`)
  - Events where user owns the event individually (`owner_context_id` when `owner_context_type = 'individual'`)
  - Events where user is a member of the organizing organization with posting rights (`owner`, `admin`, `editor` roles)

- **Improved Event Selection**:
  - Added `isOrganizer` flag to distinguish between ticket holders and organizers
  - Updated event selection UI to show "ORGANIZER" badge for events user organizes
  - Changed placeholder text to be more inclusive of both attendees and organizers

### 3. Database Queries Enhanced
- Added query for `org_memberships` to check user's role in organizations
- Added secondary query for events owned by organizations where user has posting rights
- Properly deduplicated events to prioritize organizer status over ticket holder status

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Cleaner UI**: Removed redundant buttons that caused confusion
2. **Better Access Control**: Organizers can now post to their own events without needing tickets
3. **Clear Role Indication**: Users see "ORGANIZER" badge when posting to events they organize
4. **Streamlined Flow**: Single primary create post button for consistent user experience

## Testing Verified

- ✅ Attendees can post to events they have tickets for
- ✅ Organizers can post to events they organize (both individual and organization-owned events)
- ✅ UI shows appropriate badges based on user relationship to event
- ✅ No duplicate or redundant create post buttons remain
- ✅ Primary create post button (bottom center) works correctly for all user types
