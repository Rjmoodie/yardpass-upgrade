## 📊 Complete System Overview

### **Ad Serving Pipeline**
```
1. User views feed
   ↓
2. home-feed Edge Function calls get_eligible_ads
   ↓
3. Returns ad with rate=500 credits (CPM)
   ↓
4. useImpressionTracker tracks dwell time
   ↓
5. After 1+ seconds, logs impression to ad-events
   ↓
6. Edge Function calls log_impression_and_charge RPC
   ↓
7. RPC adds 0.5 to spend_accrual (500/1000)
   ↓
8. When accrual >= 1.0, flushes to spent_credits + ledger
   ↓
9. Analytics views aggregate for dashboard
   ↓
10. Dashboard displays beautiful charts ✨

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Why Fractional Accrual?
Traditional: `CEIL(0.5) = 1` → overcharges 100%  
Accrual: `0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0` → exact billing ✅

### Why Row Locks?
Prevents race conditions where concurrent impressions could double-charge the same credit.

### Why IAB Viewability?
Industry standard: ≥50% visible for ≥1 second ensures ads are actually seen, fair to advertisers.

### Why Materialized Views?
Pre-computed aggregations make analytics dashboard load instantly, even with millions of impressions.
