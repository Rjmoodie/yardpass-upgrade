# Profile Page Improvements - Complete ✅

## Summary
All four Profile Page UX improvements have been successfully implemented and deployed.

---

## 1. ✅ Enhanced Header Icon Visibility

**Problem**: Icons in the profile header were not visible against varying background images.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced gradient overlay: `from-black/40 via-transparent to-black/80`
- Added shadow effects to all header icons: `shadow-2xl shadow-black/50`
- Improved backdrop blur and contrast for all icon buttons

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/new-design/ProfilePage.tsx` (lines 245-249)

**Result**: Icons now have strong contrast and are visible against any background image.

---

## 2. ✅ User Search in Messages Section

**Problem**: No way to search for users to start a new conversation in the Messages section.

**Solution**:
- Added "New Message" button (UserPlus icon) in Messages header
- Integrated `UserSearchModal` component with custom `onSelectUser` callback
- Clicking the button opens a searchable user directory
- Selecting a user navigates to `/messages?to={userId}` to start a conversation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/new-design/MessagesPage.tsx`:
  - Added `UserPlus` icon import
  - Added `showUserSearch` state
  - Added "New Message" button in header (lines 103-110)
  - Integrated `UserSearchModal` with navigation callback (lines 294-302)
- `src/components/follow/UserSearchModal.tsx`:
  - Added optional `onSelectUser` prop for custom behavior
  - Updated `handleStartMessage` to use callback when provided

**Result**: Users can now search for and start conversations with any user from the Messages section.

## 3. ✅ Split Events Metric (Hosted vs Attended)

**Problem**: Profile showed only a generic "Events" metric without distinguishing between events hosted (as organizer) and events attended (as attendee).

**Solution**:
- Reorganized stats card layout with a divider
- Top row: Followers, Following, Posts
- Bottom row (own profile only): **Events Hosted** and **Events Attended**
- "Events Hosted" counts tickets where `organizer_id === currentUser.id` (for organizers)
- "Events Attended" shows total ticket count
- Both metrics highlighted in brand orange color

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/new-design/ProfilePage.tsx` (lines 437-478)

**Formula**:
```typescript
Events Hosted = tickets.filter(t => t.organizer_id === currentUser?.id).length
Events Attended = tickets.length
```

**Result**: Clear differentiation between hosting and attending roles.

---

## 4. ✅ Saved Events Functionality

**Problem**: "Saved" tab existed in UI but wasn't wired up to any backend functionality.

**Solution**:

### Database (Migration: `20250131000002_saved_events.sql`)
- Created `public.saved_events` table:
  - `id`, `user_id`, `event_id`, `saved_at`
  - Foreign key to `events.events` table (not the view)
  - Unique constraint on `(user_id, event_id)`
- Added RLS policies (users can only see/manage their own saved events)
- Created `public.toggle_saved_event(event_id)` RPC for easy save/unsave
- Added performance indexes

### Frontend
- Updated `ProfilePage.tsx` to fetch saved events:
  ```typescript
  SELECT 
    id, event_id, events (id, title, cover_image_url, start_at)
  FROM saved_events
  WHERE user_id = {currentUser}
  ORDER BY saved_at DESC
  ```
- Transformed data to display in grid format (same as Posts tab)
- Clicking a saved event navigates to `/e/{eventId}`

**Files Modified**:
- `supabase/migrations/20250131000002_saved_events.sql` (new)
- `src/pages/new-design/ProfilePage.tsx` (lines 167-206)

**Result**: Users can now see their saved events, and the feature is ready for future "save" button integration on event pages.

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Header Icon Visibility
- [ ] Navigate to Profile page
- [ ] Check that all header icons (Shield, Bell, Theme, Share, Settings, Logout) are clearly visible
- [ ] Test on profiles with light and dark background images

### 2. User Search in Messages
- [ ] Navigate to Messages page
- [ ] Click the orange "New Message" button (UserPlus icon)
- [ ] Search for a user by name
- [ ] Click on a user to start a conversation
- [ ] Verify navigation to `/messages?to={userId}`

### 3. Events Hosted vs Attended
- [ ] Navigate to your own Profile page
- [ ] Verify top row shows: Followers, Following, Posts
- [ ] Verify bottom row shows: **Events Hosted** (orange) and **Events Attended** (orange)
- [ ] If you're an organizer, check that "Events Hosted" counts correctly
- [ ] Check that "Events Attended" equals your total ticket count

### 4. Saved Events
- [ ] Navigate to Profile page
- [ ] Click "Saved" tab
- [ ] Verify tab shows empty state (until save feature is added to event pages)
- [ ] Check browser console for no errors when loading saved events

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term:
1. Add "Save Event" button/heart icon on Event Detail pages
2. Add toast notifications when saving/unsaving events
3. Show saved count on event cards

### Medium-term:
1. Add "Saved Events" filter/sort options (by date, category, etc.)
2. Show event status on saved events (upcoming, past, cancelled)
3. Add batch unsave functionality

### Long-term:
1. Create "Collections" for organizing saved events
2. Share saved collections with friends
3. Get notifications when saved events have updates
