## 📖 Key Concepts

### Sponsorship Matching
The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm to match sponsors with events:

```
score = 0.25 × budget_fit
      + 0.35 × audience_overlap
      + 0.15 × geo_fit
      + 0.15 × engagement_quality
      + 0.10 × objectives_similarity
```

Each match includes explainability metrics so organizers and sponsors understand *why* they're a good fit.

### Event Insights
Real-time aggregation of:
- Attendee demographics
- Engagement metrics (dwell time, video completion)
- Conversion rates (views → ticket purchases)
- Social sentiment and mentions

### Incremental Updates
When sponsor profiles or event data change, the system:
1. Queues affected pairs in `fit_recalc_queue`
2. Worker processes queue every 5 minutes
3. Updates match scores in `sponsorship_matches`
4. Views reflect new data immediately

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests

npm run test:integration
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### SQL Testing

# Run test queries
psql $TEST_DATABASE_URL -f tests/sql/sponsorship_tests.sql
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Key Metrics

**Sponsorship Platform:**
- Match scores (avg, distribution)
- Conversion funnel (viewed → contacted → accepted)
- Queue health (pending count, processing time)
- Revenue (GMV, platform fees)

**Event Platform:**
- Ticket sales (per event, per tier)
- Video engagement (views, completions, dwell time)
- User growth (signups, retention)
- Content quality (posts per event, engagement rates)

### Dashboards

Access monitoring dashboards at:
- Supabase: `https://app.supabase.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT/database`
- Stripe: `https://dashboard.stripe.com`
- Mux: `https://dashboard.mux.com`

### Alerts

Set up alerts for:
- Queue backup (> 10,000 pending items)
- Low match scores (avg < 0.3)
- Payment failures
- Edge function errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Queue not processing**
```sql
-- Check cron job
SELECT * FROM cron.job WHERE jobname = 'sponsorship-recalc';

-- Manually trigger
SELECT net.http_post(
  url:='https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/sponsorship-recalc',
  headers:='{"Authorization": "Bearer KEY"}'::jsonb
);
```

**2. Low match scores**
```sql
-- Check if data exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sponsor_profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_audience_insights;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sponsorship_matches;

-- Inspect overlap metrics
SELECT overlap_metrics FROM sponsorship_matches LIMIT 5;
```

**3. Slow queries**
```sql
-- Analyze query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM v_sponsor_recommendations WHERE event_id = '...';

-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan;
```
