### **Test 4: Session Countdown Timer**

**Steps:**
1. Start any checkout flow (guest or member)
2. Add tickets to cart
3. Click "Purchase" to initiate checkout
4. **Before completing payment**, look for the countdown timer

2. Click "Extend Hold (+10 min)" button
3. Timer should reset/extend

### **Test 5: Cart Recovery (Abandoned Session)**

**Steps:**
1. Start a checkout flow and get redirected to Stripe
2. **Close the Stripe page** (don't complete payment)
3. Go back to the event page
4. Open the ticket purchase modal again

**Expected Results:**
- 💙 Blue notification: "Cart Recovered"
- 📦 Message: "We found your previous session. Your tickets are still reserved."
- ⏰ Countdown timer shows remaining time
- 🔄 Session status polls automatically

**Database Check:**
```sql
-- Check session status
SELECT 
    id,
    status,
    expires_at,
    created_at,
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (expires_at - NOW())) / 60 as minutes_remaining
FROM checkout_sessions
WHERE status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

---

### **Test 6: Express Payment Methods (UI Only)**

**Note:** Express payment methods are currently UI stubs. They'll show a "coming soon" toast.

**Steps:**
1. Start any checkout flow with tickets selected

### **Test 7: Complete Purchase with Stripe Test Cards**

**Steps:**
1. Complete any checkout flow above
2. On Stripe checkout page, use test cards:

**Test Cards:**
```
✅ Success (Payment Succeeds):
   Card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   Exp: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
   CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   ZIP: Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

❌ Decline (Payment Fails):
   Card: 4000 0000 0000 0002

🔐 3D Secure (Requires Authentication):
   Card: 4000 0027 6000 3184
```

3. Complete the payment

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Stripe webhook triggers `process-payment` function
- ✅ Order status updates to 'paid'
- ✅ Tickets created with QR codes
- ✅ Confirmation email sent
- ✅ Checkout session status updates to 'converted'

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check completed order
SELECT 
    o.id,
    o.status,
    o.stripe_session_id,
    o.paid_at,
    COUNT(t.id) as ticket_count,
    STRING_AGG(t.qr_code, ', ') as qr_codes
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN tickets t ON o.id = t.order_id
WHERE o.status = 'paid'
  AND o.paid_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
GROUP BY o.id, o.status, o.stripe_session_id, o.paid_at
ORDER BY o.paid_at DESC;
```

## 🔍 Edge Function Logs to Monitor

Open your Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Logs to monitor:

1. **guest-checkout** - Guest purchase initiation
2. **enhanced-checkout** - Member purchase initiation
3. **checkout-session-status** - Session polling (should see frequent calls)
4. **stripe-webhook** - Payment completion events
5. **process-payment** - Ticket creation and email sending

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No tickets selected"
- **Solution:** Make sure at least 1 ticket is selected before clicking "Purchase"

### Issue: "Email required"
- **Solution:** Enter a valid email address in the guest checkout form

### Issue: "Authentication required"
- **Solution:** For member checkout, make sure you're logged in

### Issue: "Invalid JWT"
- **Solution:** This is expected for unauthenticated API calls. Guest checkout and session-status use anon key authentication.

### Issue: Timer not showing
- **Solution:** Make sure `checkoutSessionId` is returned from the Edge Function. Check the function response in browser DevTools.

### Issue: Session recovery not working
- **Solution:** Check localStorage for `checkoutSessionId`. Clear it if stale: `localStorage.removeItem('checkoutSessionId')`

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your system is working correctly if:

1. ✅ Guest checkout creates orders and redirects to Stripe
2. ✅ Member checkout requires authentication
3. ✅ Countdown timer displays and updates in real-time
4. ✅ Cart recovery detects abandoned sessions
5. ✅ Complete purchases create tickets with QR codes
6. ✅ Confirmation emails are sent
7. ✅ Express payment UI elements render correctly
8. ✅ All Edge Functions log properly without errors
