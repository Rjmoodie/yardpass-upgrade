## 🎯 Verified Test Results

### Test Configuration
- **Campaign ID:** `3a51d5c9-b817-4c11-859f-5cd0b4c5b1ec`

## 📊 Billing Flow Confirmed

### Impression 1
```
Frontend tracks: 1s+ dwell, 50%+ visible → viewable ✅
Edge Function: receives rate=500 ✅
RPC: adds 0.5 to spend_accrual ✅
Result: spend_accrual = 0.5 ✅
Ledger: (empty - waiting for whole credit) ✅
```

### Impression 2 (Expected)
```
RPC: adds 0.5 to spend_accrual → 1.0
RPC: FLOOR(1.0) = 1 → flush to spent_credits
Ledger: INSERT 1 credit charge
Result: spent_credits = 1, spend_accrual = 0
```

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Rate Calculation Fix
**Problem:** `get_eligible_ads` returned USD value (2.06) instead of credits (500)  
**Solution:** Modified to return `bidding->>'bid_cents'` directly  
**File:** `fix-get-eligible-ads-minimal.sql`

### 2. Fractional Accrual Implementation
**Problem:** Original code used `CEIL()` which overcharged  
**Solution:** Implemented `spend_accrual` column with FLOOR logic  
**File:** `fix-cpm-billing-concurrency.sql`

### 3. Concurrency Safety
**Problem:** Race conditions possible under high load  
**Solution:** Added `FOR UPDATE` row locks  
**File:** `fix-cpm-billing-concurrency.sql`

### 4. Complete Audit Trail
**Problem:** Ledger missing wallet_id and rate_usd_cents  
**Solution:** Added missing fields to INSERT statements  
**File:** `fix-cpm-billing-concurrency.sql`

## 🎓 Implementation Insights

### Why Fractional Accrual?
Traditional approach: `CEIL(rate/1000)` would charge 1 credit per impression at CPM=500.  
**Problem:** 1 impression = 1 credit = $1.00 (should be $0.50!)

Accrual approach: Accumulate 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0, then charge 1 credit.  
**Benefit:** Exact billing. 2 impressions = 1 credit = $1.00 ✅

### Why Row Locks?
Without locks, concurrent impressions could race:
```
Thread A reads accrual=0.5
Thread B reads accrual=0.5
Thread A writes accrual=1.0, flushes
Thread B writes accrual=1.0, flushes ❌ (double charge!)
```

With `FOR UPDATE`, threads serialize:
```
Thread A locks, reads 0.5, writes 1.0, flushes, unlocks
Thread B locks, reads 0.0, writes 0.5, unlocks ✅
```

### Why Viewability Checks?
Industry standard (IAB): Only charge for ads that were actually seen.  
**Requirement:** ≥50% visible for ≥1 second  
**Benefit:** Fair to advertisers, prevents fraud

## 💰 Pricing Summary

### Credit-to-USD Ratio
```
$1.00 = 100 credits
$5.00 = 500 credits
$100.00 = 10,000 credits
```

### Campaign Budget
```
Total Budget: 10,000 credits = $100
Spent: 0.5 credits = $0.50
Remaining: 9,999.5 credits = $99.95
```

### CPM Calculation
```
CPM Rate: 500 credits = $5.00 per 1000 impressions
Per Impression: 500 ÷ 1000 = 0.5 credits = $0.005
```

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Frequency Capping
Add hour-bucket dedup to limit ad exposure:
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_ad_impressions_freq_cap 
ON campaigns.ad_impressions (campaign_id, user_id, DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at));
```

### 2. Campaign End Billing
When campaign ends, bill remaining accrual:
```sql
UPDATE campaigns.campaigns
SET spent_credits = spent_credits + CEIL(spend_accrual),
    spend_accrual = 0
WHERE status = 'ended' AND spend_accrual > 0;
```

### 3. Real-Time Budget Alerts
Notify organizers when budget thresholds reached:
- 50% spent → "Halfway through budget"
- 80% spent → "Budget running low"
- 100% spent → "Campaign paused - budget depleted"

### 4. Attribution Reporting
Link conversions (ticket purchases) back to ads:
```sql
CREATE TABLE campaigns.ad_conversions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  campaign_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns.campaigns,
  impression_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns.ad_impressions,
  click_id UUID REFERENCES campaigns.ad_clicks,
  conversion_type TEXT, -- 'ticket_purchase', 'event_save', etc.
  conversion_value NUMERIC, -- ticket price
  occurred_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
