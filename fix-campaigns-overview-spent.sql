-- FIX: campaigns_overview to use correct spent_credits
-- ========================================
-- Problem: campaigns_overview was prioritizing ledger data which wasn't being updated
-- Solution: Use campaigns.spent_credits as source of truth

-- Drop and recreate the view with correct spent_credits
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.campaigns_overview CASCADE;
