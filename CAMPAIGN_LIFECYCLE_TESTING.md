## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### A. Unit Tests (SQL)

#### Test 1: is_servable() Logic

```sql
-- Run built-in test suite
SELECT * FROM campaigns.test_is_servable();

-- Expected output: All tests should pass (passed = true)
/*
test_case                              | passed | details
---------------------------------------+--------+----------------------------------
Active campaign with budget            | true   | Should be servable
Paused campaign                        | false  | Should not be servable when paused
Budget exhausted                       | false  | Should not be servable when budget exhausted
Past end date                          | false  | Should not be servable after end date
Before start date                      | false  | Should not be servable before start date
Cleanup                                | true   | Test campaign deleted
*/
```

#### Test 2: Derived Status View

```sql
-- Check that all campaigns have correct derived_status
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  status AS db_status,
  derived_status,
  is_servable,
  not_servable_reasons,
  budget_used_pct,
  remaining_credits
FROM public.campaigns_with_status
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Verify logic:
-- - 'active' status + valid dates + budget = derived_status: 'active', is_servable: true
-- - 'paused' status = derived_status: 'paused', is_servable: false
-- - end_date passed = derived_status: 'ended', not_servable_reasons: ['past_end_date']
-- - budget exhausted = derived_status: 'budget_exhausted', not_servable_reasons: ['budget_exhausted']
```

#### Test 3: Race-Safe Charging

```sql
-- Create test campaign with 1000 credits
INSERT INTO campaigns.campaigns (
  org_id,
  created_by,
  name,
  status,
  total_budget_credits,
  spent_credits,
  start_date
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM organizations.organizations LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1),
  'Race Test Campaign',
  'active',
  1000,
  0,
  now()
) RETURNING id;

-- Try to charge 10 times at 100 credits each (total 1000)
-- Should succeed 10 times exactly, then fail
SELECT * FROM campaigns.test_concurrent_charges(
  'YOUR-CAMPAIGN-ID-HERE',  -- Replace with actual ID
  100,  -- charge amount
  12    -- number of attempts (2 should fail)
);

-- Expected: First 10 succeed, last 2 fail
-- Final spent_credits should be exactly 1000 (no overspend)

-- Verify
SELECT spent_credits, total_budget_credits 
FROM campaigns.campaigns 
WHERE name = 'Race Test Campaign';

-- Cleanup
DELETE FROM campaigns.campaigns WHERE name = 'Race Test Campaign';
```

#### Test 4: Auto-Reconciler

```sql
-- Create campaigns that should auto-complete
-- 1. Past end date
INSERT INTO campaigns.campaigns (
  org_id, created_by, name, status,
  total_budget_credits, spent_credits,
  start_date, end_date
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM organizations.organizations LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1),
  'Test - Past End Date',
  'active',
  10000, 5000,
  now() - interval '10 days',
  now() - interval '1 day'  -- Ended yesterday
);

-- 2. Budget exhausted
INSERT INTO campaigns.campaigns (
  org_id, created_by, name, status,
  total_budget_credits, spent_credits,
  start_date
) VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM organizations.organizations LIMIT 1),
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1),
  'Test - Budget Exhausted',
  'active',
  10000, 10000,  -- Fully spent
  now() - interval '5 days'
);

-- Run reconciler
SELECT * FROM campaigns.reconcile_campaign_status();

-- Expected output:
/*
campaign_id                          | old_status | new_status | reason
-------------------------------------+------------+------------+------------------
...                                  | active     | completed  | end_date_reached
...                                  | active     | completed  | budget_exhausted
*/

-- Verify status changed
SELECT name, status, derived_status 
FROM public.campaigns_with_status
WHERE name LIKE 'Test -%';

-- Cleanup
DELETE FROM campaigns.campaigns WHERE name LIKE 'Test -%';
```

### B. Integration Tests (Frontend + Backend)

#### Test 5: Status Badge Display

**Steps:**
1. Open Campaign Dashboard
2. Check each campaign card shows status badge
3. Hover over badge to see tooltip

**Expected:**
- ✅ Active campaigns show 🟢 **Active** badge (green)
- ✅ Paused campaigns show ⏸️ **Paused** badge (yellow)
- ✅ Ended campaigns show 🏁 **Ended** badge (gray)
- ✅ Budget exhausted show 💰 **Budget Exhausted** badge (red)
- ✅ Tooltip shows reason(s) why not servable

#### Test 6: Pause/Resume Functionality

**Steps:**
1. Find active campaign
2. Click "Pause" button
3. Verify ads stop serving immediately
4. Click "Resume" button
5. Verify ads start serving again

**SQL Verification:**
```sql
-- Check ad serving before pause
SELECT * FROM public.get_eligible_ads(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'feed', 10);

-- Pause campaign
UPDATE campaigns.campaigns SET status = 'paused' WHERE id = 'CAMPAIGN-ID';

-- Check ad serving after pause (should not appear)
SELECT * FROM public.get_eligible_ads(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'feed', 10);

-- Resume campaign
UPDATE campaigns.campaigns SET status = 'active' WHERE id = 'CAMPAIGN-ID';

-- Check ad serving after resume (should appear again)
SELECT * FROM public.get_eligible_ads(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 'feed', 10);
```

#### Test 7: Budget Exhaustion Handling

**Steps:**
1. Create campaign with small budget (e.g., 100 credits)
2. Let it run until budget exhausted
3. Verify:
   - Ads stop serving
   - Status shows "Budget Exhausted"
   - Final spent = exactly 100 (no overspend)

**SQL Simulation:**
```sql
-- Manually exhaust budget for testing
UPDATE campaigns.campaigns 
SET spent_credits = total_budget_credits
WHERE id = 'TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID';

-- Verify not servable
SELECT campaigns.is_servable('TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID');  -- Should return false

-- Check derived status
SELECT derived_status, not_servable_reasons
FROM public.campaigns_with_status
WHERE id = 'TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID';
-- Expected: derived_status = 'budget_exhausted', reasons = ['budget_exhausted']
```

#### Test 8: End Date Handling

**Steps:**
1. Create campaign ending tomorrow
2. Wait for end date to pass (or manually set to past)
3. Verify ads stop serving
4. Check status shows "Ended"

**SQL:**
```sql
-- Set end date to past
UPDATE campaigns.campaigns 
SET end_date = now() - interval '1 hour'
WHERE id = 'TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID';

-- Verify not servable
SELECT campaigns.is_servable('TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID');  -- Should return false

-- Run reconciler
SELECT * FROM campaigns.reconcile_campaign_status();

-- Check status updated
SELECT status, derived_status 
FROM public.campaigns_with_status
WHERE id = 'TEST-CAMPAIGN-ID';
-- Expected: status = 'completed', derived_status = 'ended'
```

---

### C. Performance Tests

#### Test 9: Concurrent Charge Load Test

**Goal:** Verify no overspend under high concurrency

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Create test campaign with 10,000 credits
INSERT INTO campaigns.campaigns (...) 
VALUES (..., 10000, 0, ...);
```

**Load Test Script** (run from application):
```javascript
// Simulate 100 concurrent charges of 100 credits each
// Expected: First 100 succeed, rest fail
// Final: spent_credits = exactly 10,000

const promises = Array.from({ length: 150 }, () =>
  supabase.rpc('try_charge_campaign', {
    p_campaign_id: 'TEST-ID',
    p_credits: 100
  })
);

const results = await Promise.all(promises);
const successes = results.filter(r => r.data === true).length;
const failures = results.filter(r => r.data === false).length;

console.log(`Successes: ${successes}, Failures: ${failures}`);
// Expected: Successes = 100, Failures = 50

// Verify final spend
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('campaigns')
  .select('spent_credits')
  .eq('id', 'TEST-ID')
  .single();

console.log(`Final spend: ${data.spent_credits}`);
// Expected: Exactly 10,000 (no overspend!)
```

#### Test 10: View Performance

**Goal:** Verify `campaigns_with_status` view performs well

```sql
-- Check query plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM public.campaigns_with_status
WHERE org_id = 'YOUR-ORG-ID'
LIMIT 50;

-- Expected: < 100ms for typical org (< 1000 campaigns)

-- If slow, consider materialized view:
/*
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW public.campaigns_with_status_mv AS
SELECT * FROM public.campaigns_with_status;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON public.campaigns_with_status_mv (id);

-- Refresh every minute
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-campaign-status',
  '* * * * *',
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY public.campaigns_with_status_mv;'
);
*/
```

## 🐛 Known Edge Cases

### 1. Timezone Handling
**Issue:** `end_date` comparison uses server `now()`, not campaign `timezone`  
**Fix:** Use `now() AT TIME ZONE campaign.timezone` in comparisons  
**Priority:** Medium

### 2. Partial Charges
**Issue:** What if impression costs 1.5 credits but only 1 credit remains?  
**Current:** Charge rejected (campaign stops at 9999 of 10000)  
**Better:** Allow "final impression" if within threshold (e.g., 10% of charge)  
**Priority:** Low

### 3. Refunds
**Issue:** If campaign paused with budget remaining, how to refund?  
**Current:** Manual process  
**Better:** Automatic refund calculation view  
**Priority:** Medium

---

## 📊 Metrics to Monitor

### Post-Deployment:
1. **Overspend Rate**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM campaigns WHERE spent_credits > total_budget_credits` (should be 0)
2. **Reconciler Lag**: Time between end_date/budget_exhausted and status='completed'
3. **Charge Rejection Rate**: How often `try_charge_campaign` returns false
4. **Status Accuracy**: % of campaigns where derived_status matches reality

---

## ✅ Sign-Off

Once all tests pass:

```bash
# Deploy to production
./deploy-campaign-lifecycle.ps1

# Monitor for 24 hours
# Check metrics every 4 hours
# Verify no overspend incidents

# If stable after 24h → ✅ Production ready
```
