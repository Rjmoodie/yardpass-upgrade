## 🚀 How to Deploy

### **Step 1: Run Database Migrations**
```bash
# Apply migrations in order
supabase migration apply 20250301000011_add_user_to_follow_target
supabase migration apply 20250301000012_attendee_following_features
```

**Important**: Run migrations in order! The enum value must be committed before it can be used.

### **Step 2: Verify Migration Success**
```sql
-- Check that 'user' was added to follow_target enum
SELECT enum_range(NULL::follow_target);
-- Should return: {organizer,event,user}

-- Verify views were created
SELECT * FROM pg_views WHERE viewname IN ('follow_profiles', 'user_search');

-- Check functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname IN ('get_user_connections', 'get_mutual_connections');
```

### **Step 3: Test the Frontend**
1. Navigate to `/social` in your app
2. Try searching for users
3. Test following/unfollowing
4. Check follow request notifications
5. Verify real-time updates

### **Step 4: Monitor Performance**
```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'follows' 
  AND indexname LIKE '%user%';
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Migration Errors**
**Error**: "unsafe use of new value 'user' of enum type"
**Solution**: Ensure migrations run in order. The enum value must be committed before use.

**Error**: "relation does not exist"
**Solution**: Check that previous migrations have run successfully.

### **Frontend Errors**
**Error**: "Cannot read property of undefined"
**Solution**: Check that user is authenticated before accessing network features.

**Error**: "Search returns no results"
**Solution**: Verify user_search view was created and data exists in user_profiles.

### **Performance Issues**
**Issue**: Slow search queries
**Solution**: Verify indexes were created: `idx_follows_user_target`, `idx_follows_user_follower`, `idx_follows_user_status`

**Issue**: Slow page load
**Solution**: Check that lazy loading is working for UserSocialPage component.
