## 📦 Files Created

### 1. **SQL Migration** ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250129000000_ai_recommendations.sql`

**What it adds:**
- ✅ `analytics.category_benchmarks` view - Compare campaigns to category median
- ✅ `campaign_increase_daily_budget()` RPC - Increase budget by %

- ✅ `campaign_update_freq_cap()` RPC - Update frequency cap
- ✅ `analytics.ai_recommendation_events` table - Track what AI suggests
- ✅ `log_ai_recommendation()` - Log when rec is shown
- ✅ `mark_ai_rec_applied()` - Mark when user applies rec
- ✅ `measure_ai_rec_lift()` - Measure actual performance lift
- ✅ `analytics.ai_recommendation_stats` view - Weekly adoption metrics

**Security:** All RPCs verify org membership before making changes

## 🎯 How to Use

### As an Advertiser:
1. Visit **Campaign Analytics** page for any campaign
2. See your KPI cards (impressions, clicks, etc.)
3. **AI Recommendations** appear automatically below
4. Review each recommendation:
   - See confidence level (Low/Medium/High)
   - Read rationale (why this helps)
   - See expected impact (what to expect)
5. Click **"Apply Recommendation"**
6. Changes take effect immediately!

### Example User Flow:
```
User: "My campaign has 1,000 impressions, 50 clicks (5% CTR)"
AI: "🎯 Your CTR (5%) beats category median (2.3%) by 117%.
     Users are highly engaged. Increase budget by 15% to capture demand."
     Expected: +15-25% impressions at current CTR
     [Apply Recommendation]

User: *clicks button*
Result: Daily budget increases from 1,000 to 1,150 credits ✅
```

---

## 📊 What Recommendations Look Like

### Example 1: High CTR
```
Title: 🎯 Capture outsized demand — increase budget
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale: Your CTR (3.2%) beats category median (1.8%) by 78%. 
           More budget scales efficiently at this performance.
Expected Impact: +15–25% impressions at current CTR
Action: Increase daily budget by 15%
```

### Example 2: Top Creative
```
Title: 🎨 Shift budget toward best creative
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale: Creative cc3d6b97 CTR 4.1% beats campaign avg 2.3% by 78%.
Expected Impact: +15–30% conversions (estimated)
Action: Shift 25% more budget to this creative
```

### Example 3: Slow Spend
```
Title: 🚀 Accelerate spend — performance is solid
Confidence: HIGH
Rationale: You've only used 15% of budget but CTR is competitive. 
           Increase daily budget while performance is strong.
Expected Impact: +40–60% budget utilization
Action: Increase daily budget by 25%
```

## 📈 Telemetry & Metrics

### What's Tracked:
```sql
analytics.ai_recommendation_events
  - What recommendations were shown
  - To which campaigns/users
  - Which ones were applied
  - When they were applied
  - Baseline metrics (before)
  - Follow-up metrics (7 days after)
  - Actual lift achieved
```

### Measure Success:
```sql
-- View adoption rates
SELECT * FROM analytics.ai_recommendation_stats;

-- Example output:
week        | total_shown | total_applied | adoption_rate | avg_lift
2025-01-27  | 45          | 12            | 26.7%         | +18.3%
2025-01-20  | 38          | 9             | 23.7%         | +15.1%
```

### Run Lift Measurement (7 days after):
```sql
-- Run via cron or manually
SELECT analytics.measure_ai_rec_lift('rec-id-here');

-- Returns:
{
  "baseline": {"impressions": 1000, "clicks": 45},
  "followup": {"impressions": 1180, "clicks": 53},
  "lift_pct": 18.0
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Visual Design:
- ✅ Card-based layout (responsive grid)
- ✅ Confidence badges (color-coded)
- ✅ Border colors (green=high, blue=medium, yellow=low)
- ✅ Icons for each rec type (🎯📈⬆️🚀🎨🔄)
- ✅ Loading spinner while analyzing
- ✅ Empty state ("No opportunities right now")
- ✅ Error state with retry button

### Interactions:
- ✅ One-click apply
- ✅ Copy recommendation to clipboard
- ✅ Toast notifications on success/error
- ✅ Optimistic UI (rec disappears when applied)
- ✅ Touch-optimized buttons (min 36px height)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Access Control:
```sql
-- Every RPC checks org membership
IF NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM organization_memberships
  WHERE org_id = v_org_id AND user_id = auth.uid()
) THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Access denied';
END IF;
```

### Auth Requirements:
- ✅ User must be authenticated (`auth.uid()`)
- ✅ User must be member of campaign's org
- ✅ Edge function uses service role (read-only queries)
- ✅ RPCs use security definer with access checks

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No recommendations appearing"
**Causes:**
- Campaign too new (< 3 days of data)
- Not enough impressions (< 100)
- Edge function not deployed

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Redeploy edge function
supabase functions deploy ai-recommend --no-verify-jwt

# Check logs
supabase functions logs ai-recommend
```

### "Apply button not working"
**Causes:**
- RPC not deployed
- User not org member
- Campaign not found

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Reapply migration
supabase db push

# Check RPC exists
supabase db execute "SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname = 'campaign_increase_daily_budget'"
```

### "Permission denied error"
**Cause:** User not member of campaign's org

**Fix:** Verify org membership in database
