-- 8. Grants & RLS
-- ===================================================================
-- Allow authenticated and anon users to read analytics views
GRANT SELECT ON public.analytics_campaign_daily TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.analytics_creative_daily TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.analytics_viewability_campaign TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.analytics_attribution_campaign TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON public.analytics_campaign_daily_mv TO authenticated, anon;

-- Allow authenticated users to call refresh function (for manual refresh)
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.refresh_analytics() TO authenticated;

-- Grant usage on util schema
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA util TO authenticated, anon;
GRANT SELECT ON util.calendar_day TO authenticated, anon;

-- Initial refresh
SELECT public.refresh_analytics();

-- ===================================================================
-- Migration Complete
-- ===================================================================
-- Created:
--   - util.calendar_day (seeded with 395 days)
--   - public.analytics_campaign_daily (view)
--   - public.analytics_creative_daily (view)
--   - public.analytics_viewability_campaign (view)
--   - public.analytics_attribution_campaign (view)
--   - public.analytics_campaign_daily_mv (materialized view)
--   - public.refresh_analytics() (function)
--
-- Next steps:
--   1. Set up cron job to call refresh_analytics() every 5 minutes
--   2. Update frontend to query analytics_campaign_daily_mv
--   3. Drop old RPC functions (rpc_campaign_analytics_daily, etc.)
