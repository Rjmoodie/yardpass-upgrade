-- ========================================
-- FIX: analytics_campaign_daily to show DAILY spend, not cumulative
-- ========================================
-- Problem: The view currently shows campaign.spent_credits (total) on every row
-- Solution: Calculate daily spend from impression/click costs for that day

-- Drop the existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.analytics_campaign_daily CASCADE;

-- Recreate with correct daily spend calculation
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.analytics_campaign_daily AS
SELECT 
  c.id AS campaign_id,
  c.org_id,
  cd.day,
  COALESCE(imp.impressions, 0) AS impressions,
  COALESCE(clk.clicks, 0) AS clicks,
  COALESCE(conv.conversions, 0) AS conversions,
  
  -- âœ… FIXED: Calculate actual daily spend from events on that day
  -- Get spend from the ledger for this specific day
  COALESCE(ledger.daily_spend, 0) AS spend_credits,
