## 🎯 Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Sponsor Discovery → Purchase

```
1. Sponsor browses marketplace
   → Query: v_sponsorship_package_cards
   
2. View package details
   → Query: SELECT FROM sponsorship_packages JOIN mv_event_reach_snapshot
   
3. Check match score
   → RPC: fn_compute_match_score(event_id, sponsor_id)
   
4. Create proposal
   → INSERT INTO proposal_threads
   
5. Negotiate via messages
   → INSERT INTO proposal_messages
   
6. Accept & create order
   → INSERT INTO sponsorship_orders
   
7. Process payment (Stripe)
   → Webhook → UPDATE status = 'paid'
   
8. Queue payout
   → Call: queue_sponsorship_payout()
   
9. Process payout
   → Cron: process_payout_queue()
```

### Workflow 2: Event Organizer → Sponsor Acquisition

```
1. Organizer views event dashboard
   → Query: v_event_recommended_sponsors WHERE event_id = ?
   
2. Review top matches
   → Shows: score, breakdown, sponsor profile
   
3. Invite sponsor to negotiate
   → INSERT INTO proposal_threads
   
4. Define deliverables
   → INSERT INTO deliverables
   
5. Set SLAs
   → INSERT INTO sponsorship_slas
   
6. Finalize contract
   → UPDATE proposal_threads SET status = 'accepted'
   → INSERT INTO sponsorship_orders
```

### Workflow 3: Deliverable Tracking

```
1. Sponsor views deliverable queue
   → Query: SELECT FROM deliverables WHERE sponsor_id = ? AND status IN ('pending')
   
2. Upload proof of performance
   → INSERT INTO deliverable_proofs
   
3. Organizer reviews proof
   → UPDATE deliverable_proofs SET approved_at = now()
   
4. Mark deliverable complete
   → UPDATE deliverables SET status = 'approved'
   
5. Release payment (if milestone-based)
   → Process payout from escrow
```

## 📈 Key Metrics & KPIs

### Match Quality Metrics
```sql
-- Match score distribution
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN score >= 0.8 THEN 'Excellent (80%+)'
    WHEN score >= 0.6 THEN 'Good (60-80%)'
    WHEN score >= 0.4 THEN 'Fair (40-60%)'
    ELSE 'Poor (<40%)'
  END as tier,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(score) * 100, 1) as avg_score
FROM sponsorship_matches
GROUP BY tier
ORDER BY avg_score DESC;
```

### Marketplace Health
```sql
-- Available packages by quality tier
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN quality_score >= 80 THEN 'Premium'
    WHEN quality_score >= 60 THEN 'High'
    WHEN quality_score >= 40 THEN 'Medium'
    ELSE 'Standard'
  END as tier,
  COUNT(*) as packages,
  SUM(inventory - sold) as available_slots,
  AVG(price_cents) / 100 as avg_price
FROM sponsorship_packages
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY tier;
```

### Revenue Metrics
```sql
-- Monthly sponsorship revenue
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) as month,
  COUNT(*) as orders,
  SUM(amount_cents) / 100.0 as revenue,
  AVG(amount_cents) / 100.0 as avg_order_value
FROM sponsorship_orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

### Proposal Conversion Funnel
```sql
-- Proposal status distribution
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 1) as percentage
FROM proposal_threads
WHERE created_at >= now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

---

## 🔧 Operations & Maintenance

### Daily Tasks
```sql
-- 1. Check queue health
SELECT * FROM check_recalc_queue_health();

-- 2. Monitor payout processing
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM payout_queue GROUP BY status;

-- 3. Validate data integrity
SELECT * FROM validate_sponsorship_data();
```

### Weekly Tasks
```sql
-- 1. Review match quality
SELECT AVG(score) as avg_quality FROM sponsorship_matches WHERE score >= 0.5;

-- 2. Check partition health
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'event_impressions_p_%' 
ORDER BY tablename DESC LIMIT 3;

-- 3. MV refresh log
SELECT * FROM mv_refresh_log ORDER BY ran_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Monthly Tasks
```sql
-- 1. Generate embeddings for new events/sponsors
-- (Run your embedding generation script)

-- 2. Review and adjust scoring weights if needed
-- (Based on feedback data in match_feedback table)

-- 3. Archive old partitions (if needed)
-- (Drop partitions older than retention period)
```
