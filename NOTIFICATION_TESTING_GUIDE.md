## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bell Icon Not Showing
- Make sure you're on `/profile` page (notifications only show there)
- Check browser console for errors

### No Notifications Appearing
- Verify your user_id is correct
- Check SQL query ran successfully
- Refresh the page

### Badge Not Updating
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't Mark as Read
- Check RLS policies in Supabase
- Verify you're logged in with the correct user

## üìù Notes

- Notifications are **profile-page only** (not global)
- Real notifications come from:
  - Post likes/comments
  - Event updates
  - Ticket purchases
  - Payment issues
  - Campaign updates
- Test notifications use realistic timestamps
- Bell has **no glow effect** (clean design)
