```

### Configuration

Edit `frontend-ticketing-test.js` and update:

```javascript
const config = {
  supabaseUrl: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',          // From .env
  supabaseAnonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY', // From .env
  testEventId: 'YOUR_TEST_EVENT_ID',         // Get from SQL query
  testTierId: 'YOUR_TEST_TIER_ID',           // Get from SQL query
  
  concurrentUsers: 20,
  ticketsPerUser: 2,
  totalAvailable: 50,
};
```

💡 **Get test IDs with this SQL:**

```sql
-- Get test event
SELECT id, title 
FROM events 
WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST]%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Get tier for that event
SELECT id, name, quantity 
FROM ticket_tiers 
WHERE event_id = 'YOUR_EVENT_ID';
```

### How to Run

```bash
# Run all tests
node tests/load/frontend-ticketing-test.js

# Or run individual tests (edit file to uncomment)
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No users found"

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Create a test user in Supabase Auth Dashboard or run:
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
```

### Issue: SQL syntax errors

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using PostgreSQL 14+
- Check that all required functions exist
- Run schema migrations first

### Issue: Permission denied

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Make sure you're running as service role in SQL Editor
-- Or check RLS policies
```

### Issue: "Tier not found" in JavaScript tests

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Run this SQL to find your test event/tier IDs:
SELECT e.id as event_id, tt.id as tier_id, tt.name
FROM events e
JOIN ticket_tiers tt ON tt.event_id = e.id
WHERE e.title LIKE '[LOAD TEST]%'
ORDER BY e.created_at DESC;

// Copy the IDs into your config
```

## 🔄 Cleanup

After testing, clean up test data:

```sql
-- Clean up ticketing test data
DELETE FROM ticket_holds WHERE session_id LIKE 'test-%';
DELETE FROM ticket_tiers WHERE event_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM events WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST]%'
);
DELETE FROM events WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST]%';

-- Clean up feed test data
DELETE FROM post_reactions WHERE post_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM event_posts WHERE event_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM events WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST] Feed%'
  )
);
DELETE FROM event_posts WHERE event_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM events WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST] Feed%'
);
DELETE FROM events WHERE title LIKE '[LOAD TEST] Feed%';

-- Clean up search test data
DELETE FROM events WHERE title LIKE '%Music Festival%' 
  AND created_at > now() - interval '1 day';

-- Clean up credit/wallet test data
DELETE FROM credit_lots WHERE created_at > now() - interval '1 day';
```

---

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Always test in staging first** - Never run load tests on production
2. **Clean up after testing** - Use the cleanup scripts above
3. **Monitor database** - Watch for slow queries in Supabase Dashboard
4. **Test incrementally** - Start with small numbers, scale up
5. **Document results** - Keep track of performance over time
6. **Test edge cases** - Try boundary conditions (0 tickets, max capacity, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

After running these tests:

1. ✅ Review all results and document performance
2. ✅ Fix any failures or performance issues
3. ✅ Re-run tests to verify fixes
4. ✅ Set up continuous testing (run before each deployment)
5. ✅ Monitor production metrics after launch

**Happy Testing! 🎉**
