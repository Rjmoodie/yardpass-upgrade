-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to see what's missing
-- ============================================================

-- 1. Check if schemas exist
-- ============================================================

-- 2. Check if specific tables exist
-- ============================================================

-- 3. Check if RPC functions exist
-- ============================================================
SELECT 
  'public.rpc_creative_analytics_rollup' AS function_name,
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.routines 
    WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
    AND routine_name = 'rpc_creative_analytics_rollup'
  ) AS exists;

-- 4. Check what tables ARE in public schema (for comparison)
-- ============================================================
SELECT 
  'PUBLIC SCHEMA TABLES' AS info,
  string_agg(table_name, ', ' ORDER BY table_name) AS tables_available
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

-- 5. Summary: What's missing?
-- ============================================================
