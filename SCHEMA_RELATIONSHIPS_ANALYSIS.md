## ✅ Foreign Key Integrity Check

### **All Critical Relationships Preserved:**

✅ **Users ↔ Everything** - All user_id foreign keys intact
✅ **Organizations ↔ Events** - org_id relationships maintained
✅ **Events ↔ Tickets** - event_id foreign keys preserved
✅ **Tickets ↔ Orders** - order relationships maintained
✅ **Sponsors ↔ Campaigns** - sponsorship links intact
✅ **Analytics ↔ All** - tracking relationships preserved

### **Migration Method Benefits:**

Using `ALTER TABLE SET SCHEMA` preserved:
- ✅ All foreign key constraints
- ✅ All indexes
- ✅ All triggers
- ✅ All check constraints
- ✅ All RLS policies

**Result: ALL RELATIONSHIPS INTACT! ✅**

    u.display_name,
    e.title AS event_created,
    t.id AS ticket_owned,
    p.text AS post_made,
    a.event_type AS analytics_action
FROM users.user_profiles u
LEFT JOIN events.events e ON e.created_by = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN ticketing.tickets t ON t.owner_user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN events.event_posts p ON p.author_user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN analytics.analytics_events a ON a.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE u.user_id = 'some-user-id';
```

## 🔧 How Connections Work

### **1. Direct Foreign Keys**

```sql
-- Example: tickets → users
ALTER TABLE ticketing.tickets
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_tickets_user
FOREIGN KEY (owner_user_id) 
REFERENCES users.user_profiles(user_id);
```

### **2. Polymorphic Relationships**

```sql
-- Example: events can be owned by user OR organization
events.events:
  owner_context_id (UUID)
  owner_context_type (ENUM: 'user', 'organization')
```

### **3. Junction Tables**

```sql
-- Example: many-to-many relationships
organizations.org_memberships:
  org_id → organizations.organizations
  user_id → users.user_profiles
```

### **4. Lookup/Reference**

```sql
-- Example: currency codes
events.events:
  currency_code → ref.currencies (lookup, no FK)
```

---

## 💡 Why This Structure Works

### **1. Clear Domain Boundaries**
- Each schema has a specific responsibility
- Schemas are cohesive (related tables together)
- Minimal coupling, high cohesion

### **2. Flexible Relationships**
- Foreign keys enforce data integrity
- Polymorphic patterns for flexibility
- Junction tables for many-to-many

### **3. Scalable Architecture**
- Partitioned analytics for performance
- Schema-level permissions
- Independent schema evolution

### **4. Query Optimization**
- Related data in same schema (fewer joins)
- Cross-schema joins still efficient
- Indexes preserved during migration

---

## 🎯 Testing the Connections

### **Run This Query in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Test all major cross-schema connections
SELECT 
    'users → events' AS connection,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM events.events e
JOIN users.user_profiles u ON u.user_id = e.created_by

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'events → tickets',
    COUNT(*)
FROM ticketing.tickets t
JOIN events.events e ON e.id = t.event_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'users → tickets',
    COUNT(*)
FROM ticketing.tickets t
JOIN users.user_profiles u ON u.user_id = t.owner_user_id

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'organizations → events',
    COUNT(*)
FROM events.events e
JOIN organizations.organizations o ON o.id = e.owner_context_id
WHERE e.owner_context_type = 'organization'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'events → analytics',
    COUNT(*)
FROM analytics.analytics_events a
JOIN events.events e ON e.id = a.event_id

ORDER BY count DESC;
```

**Expected: All connections return counts > 0 ✅**
