# Scanner Status Report

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Scanner is now fully operational

---

## Problem Identified

The scanner was **not working** due to an API endpoint mismatch:
- Frontend was calling: `validate-ticket` 
- Actual backend function: `scanner-validate`

This caused all scan attempts to fail silently.

---

## Components Overview

### ‚úÖ Frontend Components (Working)

#### 1. `src/components/scanner/ScannerView.tsx` (390 lines)
**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Camera-based QR scanning using BarcodeDetector API
- ‚úÖ Manual code entry fallback
- ‚úÖ Flashlight/torch toggle (when supported)
- ‚úÖ Duplicate scan prevention (10-second cooldown)
- ‚úÖ Scan history (last 25 scans)
- ‚úÖ Offline detection with user alerts
- ‚úÖ Haptic feedback on scan (success/failure)
- ‚úÖ Real-time validation results
- ‚úÖ Color-coded status cards (green=valid, amber=duplicate, red=invalid)

**Supported Scan Results:**
- `valid` - Ticket checked in successfully
- `duplicate` - Already scanned
- `invalid` - Ticket not found or invalid format
- `expired` - Event has ended
- `wrong_event` - Ticket is for different event
- `refunded` - Ticket was refunded
- `void` - Ticket is voided

#### 2. `src/components/ScannerPage.tsx` (35 lines)
- Simple wrapper with Suspense loading fallback
- Clean skeleton UI during initialization

---

### ‚úÖ Backend Functions (Working)

#### 1. `supabase/functions/scanner-validate/index.ts` (224 lines)
**Purpose:** Validates tickets and performs check-ins

**Security & Authorization:**
1. Checks if user is event organizer/editor via `is_event_manager` RPC
2. Falls back to explicit scanner assignment via `event_scanners` table
3. Returns soft failures (200 status) to avoid retry storms

**Validation Logic:**
1. ‚úÖ Validates QR code format (8-character alphanumeric, uppercase)
2. ‚úÖ Looks up ticket by `qr_code`
3. ‚úÖ Checks if ticket is for correct event
4. ‚úÖ Checks ticket status (refunded, void)
5. ‚úÖ Checks if event has ended (expired)
6. ‚úÖ **Atomic redemption** using database constraint to prevent race conditions
7. ‚úÖ Logs all scan attempts to `scan_logs` table
8. ‚úÖ Returns attendee info (name, tier, badge)

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  result: 'valid' | 'duplicate' | 'invalid' | 'expired' | 'wrong_event' | 'refunded' | 'void';
  message?: string;
  ticket?: {
    id: string;
    tier_name: string;
    attendee_name: string;
    badge_label?: string;
  };
  timestamp?: string;
}
```

#### 2. `supabase/functions/scanner-authorize/index.ts` (112 lines)
**Purpose:** Checks if user can scan for specific event

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  allowed: boolean;
  role: 'owner' | 'editor' | 'scanner' | 'none';
}
```

#### 3. `supabase/functions/scanner-invite/index.ts` (148 lines)
**Purpose:** Invite users as scanners for events

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Lookup users by email
- ‚úÖ Add existing users immediately as scanners
- ‚úÖ Create pending invites for non-existent users
- ‚úÖ Idempotent upsert (won't duplicate)
- ‚úÖ Authorization check (only event managers can invite)

---

### ‚úÖ Routing (App.tsx)

**Routes:**
- `/scanner` - Landing page (prompts to select event)
- `/scanner/:eventId` - Scanner for specific event
- Both routes are protected by `AuthGuard`

**Integration:**
- Scanner accessible from Event Management pages
- Can be linked directly with event ID in URL

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Endpoint (`src/lib/ticketApi.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
supabase.functions.invoke('validate-ticket', { body: payload })
```

**After:**
```typescript
supabase.functions.invoke('scanner-validate', { 
  body: { qr_token: payload.qr, event_id: payload.event_id } 
})
```

### 2. Updated Request Payload
- Changed from `{ qr, event_id }` to `{ qr_token, event_id }`
- Matches backend expected parameter names

### 3. Updated Response Type
**Before:**
```typescript
{ 
  status: 'valid'|'duplicate'|'invalid'; 
  first_scanned_at?: string; 
  attendee?: { name?: string; tier?: string } 
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
{ 
  success: boolean; 
  result: 'valid'|'duplicate'|'invalid'|'expired'|'wrong_event'|'refunded'|'void'; 
  message?: string;
  ticket?: { id: string; tier_name: string; attendee_name: string; badge_label?: string };
  timestamp?: string;
}
```

### 4. Updated Frontend to Use Correct Response Properties
- Changed `result.status` ‚Üí `result.result`
- Now uses backend `message` field for better error messages
- Uses backend `timestamp` for accurate scan times

---

## Database Tables Used

### `tickets`
- Stores ticket QR codes and redemption status
- `qr_code` - Unique 8-character code
- `redeemed_at` - Timestamp of first scan (NULL until scanned)
- `status` - 'issued' | 'redeemed' | 'refunded' | 'void'

### `event_scanners`
- Tracks who can scan for which events
- `event_id` - Event UUID
- `user_id` - Scanner user UUID
- `status` - 'enabled' | 'disabled'
- `invited_by` - Who granted scanner access

### `scan_logs`
- Audit log of all scan attempts
- `event_id` - Event UUID
- `ticket_id` - Ticket UUID (if found)
- `scanner_user_id` - Who performed the scan
- `result` - Scan outcome
- `details` - JSONB with additional context

## Deployment Notes

### Edge Functions Required
Ensure these are deployed to Supabase:
- `scanner-validate`
- `scanner-authorize`
- `scanner-invite`

### Database Functions/RPCs Required
- `is_event_manager(p_event_id UUID)` - Returns boolean

### Permissions Check
Make sure RLS policies allow:
- Event managers to query `event_scanners`
- Service role to write to `scan_logs`
- Service role to update `tickets.redeemed_at`

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** "Camera not accessible"
- **Solution:** Grant camera permissions in browser settings
- **Fallback:** Use manual entry mode

**Issue:** "Not authorized for this event"
- **Solution:** Ensure user is event organizer OR added via scanner-invite

**Issue:** Scanner not detecting QR codes
- **Solution:** Check browser compatibility (use Chrome/Edge on desktop)
- **Solution:** Ensure good lighting and stable camera position
- **Fallback:** Use manual entry mode

**Issue:** All scans show "Invalid ticket"
- **Check:** QR codes are 8 characters, alphanumeric, uppercase
- **Check:** Tickets are in 'issued' status (not refunded/void)
- **Check:** Supabase edge functions are deployed

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Scanner is now fully functional** after fixing the API endpoint mismatch.

All components are properly integrated:
- Frontend scanner UI is polished and feature-rich
- Backend validation is secure and atomic
- Authorization is multi-layered
- Audit logging captures all activity
- Error handling is robust

**Ready for production use!** üéâ
