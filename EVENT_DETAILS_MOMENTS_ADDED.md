# ✅ Event Details Page - Moments/Posts Added

## Date: October 24, 2025

The "Moments" (event posts) functionality has been successfully added to the new EventDetailsPage design.

---

## 🎯 What Are "Moments"?

**Moments** are user-generated posts that attendees and organizers share about an event. They can include:
- Photos from the event
- Videos of performances/highlights
- Comments and experiences
- Social media-style updates

In the codebase, moments are handled by the **`EventFeed`** component, which displays posts from the `event_posts` table.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### **1. Added EventFeed Component**

**Import:**
```typescript
import { EventFeed } from "@/components/EventFeed";
import { MessageCircle } from "lucide-react";
```

### **2. Added "Posts" Tab**

**Updated Tab State:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'about' | 'tickets' | 'attendees'>('about');

// AFTER
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<'about' | 'tickets' | 'attendees' | 'posts'>('about');
```

**Updated Tab Array:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
{(['about', 'tickets', 'attendees'] as const).map((tab) => (

// AFTER
{(['about', 'tickets', 'posts', 'attendees'] as const).map((tab) => (
```

### **3. Added Posts Tab Content**

```typescript
{activeTab === 'posts' && (
  <div className="space-y-4">
    {/* Header */}
    <div className="mb-4">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-3">
        <MessageCircle className="h-5 w-5 text-[#FF8C00]" />
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Event Moments</h3>
      </div>
      <p className="text-sm text-white/60 mb-4">
        See what attendees are sharing about this event
      </p>
    </div>
    
    {/* EventFeed Component */}
    {eventId && (
      <EventFeed 
        eventId={eventId}
        userId={user?.id}
        onEventClick={(id) => navigate(`/e/${id}`)}
      />
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

1. **About** - Event description, categories, venue details
2. **Tickets** - Ticket tiers and purchasing

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Data Flow:**

1. User clicks **"Posts"** tab
2. `EventFeed` component loads
3. Fetches posts from `event_posts` table filtered by `event_id`
4. Displays posts with media, reactions, comments
5. Real-time subscription updates when new posts are added

### **Database Query:**

```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  author_user_id,
  event_id,
  content_text,
  media_urls,
  created_at,
  user_profiles (display_name, photo_url),
  event_reactions (kind),
  comments (id)
FROM event_posts
WHERE event_id = ${eventId}
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Component Props:**

```typescript
<EventFeed 
  eventId={eventId}           // Required: Event ID to filter posts
  userId={user?.id}           // Optional: Current user for interactions
  onEventClick={(id) => ...}  // Optional: Handler for event navigation
/>
```
