## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow
```

     ‚Üì                  ‚Üì                  ‚Üì                  ‚Üì
event_impressions  event_audience_  sponsorship_    v_sponsor_
ticket_analytics     insights         matches      recommendations

                                  v_event_recommendations
```

### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
score = 0.25 √ó budget_fit
      + 0.35 √ó audience_overlap  // Highest weight
      + 0.15 √ó geo_fit
      + 0.15 √ó engagement_quality
      + 0.10 √ó objectives_similarity
```

### Performance Strategy
- **GIN indexes** for array/JSONB lookups (O(log n))
- **Materialized views** for batch scoring (refresh nightly)
- **Queue-based** incremental updates (5-min processing)
- **Partitioning-ready** for future scale (monthly partitions)

## üìä What You Can Do Now

### For Organizers
```sql
-- View top sponsor matches for your event
SELECT * FROM v_sponsor_recommendations
WHERE event_id = 'YOUR_EVENT_ID'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### For Sponsors
```sql
-- View top event opportunities
SELECT * FROM v_event_recommendations
WHERE sponsor_id = 'YOUR_SPONSOR_ID'
  AND available_packages > 0
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### For Admins
```sql
-- Monitor system health
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sponsor_profiles) AS sponsors,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_audience_insights) AS events_with_insights,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sponsorship_matches) AS total_matches,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fit_recalc_queue WHERE processed_at IS NULL) AS queue_pending,
  (SELECT AVG(score) FROM sponsorship_matches) AS avg_match_score;
```

---

## üß™ Test Plan

### 1. Seed Test Data
```sql
-- Create test sponsor
INSERT INTO sponsor_profiles (sponsor_id, industry, preferred_categories, regions, annual_budget_cents)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM sponsors WHERE name = 'Test Corp' LIMIT 1),
  'technology',
  ARRAY['music', 'tech'],
  ARRAY['US', 'CA'],
  5000000
);

-- Create test event insights
INSERT INTO event_audience_insights (event_id, engagement_score, attendee_count, geo_distribution)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM events WHERE visibility = 'public' LIMIT 1),
  0.75,
  250,
  '{"US": 180, "CA": 50, "MX": 20}'::jsonb
);
```

### 2. Trigger Match Calculation
```bash
# Queue recalc
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/sponsorship-score-onchange \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY" \
  -d '{"sponsor_id":"...", "event_id":"..."}'

# Run worker
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/sponsorship-recalc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

### 3. Verify Results
```sql
-- Check match created
SELECT
  sm.score,
  sm.overlap_metrics,
  sm.status,
  e.title AS event,
  s.name AS sponsor
FROM sponsorship_matches sm
JOIN events e ON e.id = sm.event_id
JOIN sponsors s ON s.id = sm.sponsor_id
ORDER BY sm.score DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## üí° Best Practices

### For Development
1. Test queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` before deploying
2. Use `LIMIT` when experimenting with large tables
3. Create backups before bulk updates
4. Monitor queue size during initial rollout

### For Operations
1. Set up alerts for queue backup (> 10k pending)
2. Monitor average match scores (should be > 0.4)
3. Track conversion funnel weekly
4. Vacuum/analyze tables monthly

### For Analytics
1. Use provided SQL recipes as starting point
2. Export results to CSV for deeper analysis
3. A/B test scoring weights before permanent changes
4. Validate high-score matches with real conversions

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current
1. **Objectives similarity** uses baseline 0.5 (no NLP yet)
2. **Budget fit** is simplified (no package price integration)
3. **No ML ranking** (rule-based scoring only)
4. **Queue serial processing** (not parallelized)

### Mitigation
- All limitations are flagged with `// TODO: Phase 2` comments
- Scoring weights can be tuned to compensate
- Architecture designed for easy ML integration
- Horizontal scaling possible via queue partitioning
