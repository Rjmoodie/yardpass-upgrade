# ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy

## Fixed Issues:
1. âœ… Corrected `reserve_tickets_batch` RPC call (removed duplicate `p_items` parameter)
2. âœ… Removed `application_fee_amount` from guest-checkout (requires Stripe Connect)

## What to Deploy:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy guest-checkout
npx supabase functions deploy enhanced-checkout
```

## After Deployment:
Test the guest checkout flow again. It should now:
1. âœ… Reserve tickets successfully
2. âœ… Create Stripe checkout session
3. âœ… Redirect to Stripe payment page

The fees will still be calculated and shown to the user, but they'll be part of the total amount charged, not a separate application fee.

## Note on Fees:
- Without Stripe Connect, fees are included in the ticket price
- To collect platform fees separately, you'll need to set up Stripe Connect
- For now, the system works without it - fees are just part of the ticket price
