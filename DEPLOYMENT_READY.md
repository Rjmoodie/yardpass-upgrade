## 📈 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify Deployment**
   ```sql
   -- Check tables
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
   AND table_name LIKE '%sponsor%';
   
   -- Check views
   SELECT viewname FROM pg_views 
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   
   -- Check functions
   SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
   WHERE routine_schema = 'public';
   ```

2. **Initial Data Setup**
   - Create sponsor profiles
   - Add event audience insights
   - Set up payout configurations

3. **Test Key Features**
   - Run match scoring: `SELECT * FROM fn_compute_match_score('event-id', 'sponsor-id');`
   - Test search: `SELECT * FROM semantic_event_search('music festival', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 10);`
   - Check recommendations: `SELECT * FROM get_sponsor_recommendations('event-id', 10);`

4. **Monitor System Health**
   ```sql
   -- Queue health
   SELECT * FROM check_recalc_queue_health();
   
   -- Marketplace analytics
   SELECT * FROM v_marketplace_analytics;
   
   -- Refresh log
   SELECT * FROM mv_refresh_log ORDER BY ran_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
