## 📊 Component Comparison

### **Old SearchPage** (`src/components/SearchPage.tsx`)
- **Data Source:** Mock data (MOCK_RESULTS array)
- **Navigation:** Uses `onEventSelect` callback prop

- **Design:** Basic Figma-style glassmorphic design

### **New SearchPage** (`src/pages/new-design/SearchPage.tsx`)  
- **Data Source:** Real Supabase database ✅

## 🔧 Database Integration Details

### **Query Structure:**

```typescript
supabase
  .from('events')
  .select(`
    id,
    title,
    description,
    start_at,
    venue,
    address,
    cover_image_url,
    category,
    ticket_tiers!fk_ticket_tiers_event_id (
      price_cents
    ),
    user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey (
      display_name
    )
  `)
  .eq('visibility', 'public')
  .or(`title.ilike.%${searchQuery}%,description.ilike.%${searchQuery}%`)
  .eq('category', selectedCategory)  // if not 'All'
  .gte('start_at', now.toISOString())  // future events only
  .order('start_at', { ascending: true })
  .limit(50);
```

### **Filter Logic:**

**Price Filtering (Client-Side):**
```typescript
const minPrice = event.ticket_tiers?.reduce((min, tier) => 
  Math.min(min, tier.price_cents || Infinity), Infinity);

if (priceRange === 'free' && minPrice > 0) return null;
if (priceRange === 'under-50' && minPrice >= 5000) return null;
if (priceRange === 'over-50' && minPrice < 5000) return null;
```

**Date Filtering (Server-Side):**
```typescript
if (dateFilter === 'today') {
  query = query.gte('start_at', now).lte('start_at', endOfDay);
} else if (dateFilter === 'week') {
  query = query.gte('start_at', now).lte('start_at', endOfWeek);
} else if (dateFilter === 'month') {
  query = query.gte('start_at', now).lte('start_at', endOfMonth);
} else {
  query = query.gte('start_at', now);  // future events
}
```
