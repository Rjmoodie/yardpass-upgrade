## Summary
Strengthened border colors in light mode for better visibility against pure white backgrounds.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

### Before (Too Subtle ❌)
```css
/* Light mode borders were too light */
--border: 215 32% 86%;           /* 86% lightness */
--border-strong: 215 25% 80%;    /* 80% lightness */
--tab-active-border: 215 32% 88%; /* 88% lightness */
```

**Result**: Only 14-20% contrast against pure white (100%)  
**Impact**: Borders were barely visible on ticket cards, QR sections, and inputs

### Dark Mode (Always Good ✅)
```css
/* Dark mode borders have great contrast */
--border: 0 0% 22%;              /* 22% lightness */
```

**Result**: 22% contrast against pure black (0%)  
**Impact**: Borders are clearly visible

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Darkened Border Variables
```css
/* Light Mode - NOW */
:root {
  --border: 215 32% 78%;           /* Was 86%, now 78% ✅ */
  --input: 215 32% 80%;            /* Was 86%, now 80% ✅ */
  --border-strong: 215 25% 70%;    /* Was 80%, now 70% ✅ */
  --tab-active-border: 215 32% 75%; /* Was 88%, now 75% ✅ */
  --toast-border: 215 32% 78%;     /* Was 86%, now 78% ✅ */
}
```

**New Contrast**: 22-30% against pure white  
**Impact**: Borders are now clearly visible!

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why These Values?

**78% Lightness** (Main borders):
- 22% contrast against white
- Matches dark mode contrast (22% on black)
- Clear without being harsh

**70% Lightness** (Strong borders):
- 30% contrast against white
- For emphasized elements
- Stronger definition

**80% Lightness** (Input fields):
- 20% contrast against white
- Slightly softer for large areas
- Still clearly visible

## 🎨 Color Science

### Perceptual Balance
```
Pure White:        100% lightness
Card Background:    99% lightness (1% difference)
Border:            78% lightness (22% difference) ✅
Text:              11% lightness (89% difference) ✅
```

**Result**: Clear visual hierarchy!

### Why Not Darker?
Going below 70% would make borders too heavy and compete with text. The sweet spot is 70-80% for:
- Clear visibility ✅
- Professional appearance ✅
- Not overwhelming ✅
