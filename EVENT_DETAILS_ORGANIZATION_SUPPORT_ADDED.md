# ‚úÖ Event Details - Organization Support Added

## Date: October 24, 2025

Updated EventDetailsPage to properly show organization information when events are hosted by organizations (not individual users).

---

## üêõ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Event page was always showing the user who created the event, even when the event was actually hosted by an organization.

**User Feedback:** "still seeing user name as event organizer, rather than the orgatiztion of the event"

**Root Cause:** The query wasn't fetching organization data, and the logic didn't check `owner_context_type` to determine if the event was user-owned or organization-owned.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### **1. Added Organizations to Database Query**

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey (
  user_id,
  display_name,
  photo_url
)
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
owner_context_type,
owner_context_id,
user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey (
  user_id,
  display_name,
  photo_url
),
organizations!events_owner_context_id_fkey (
  name,
  logo_url
)
```

### **2. Updated Interface**

**Added Fields:**
```typescript
interface EventDetails {
  ...
  ownerContextType: 'user' | 'organization';  // NEW
  ownerContextId: string;                     // NEW
  organizer: {
    id: string;
    name: string;    // Now can be user OR org name
    avatar: string;  // Now can be photo OR logo
  };
  ...
}
```

### **3. Added Smart Organizer Detection**

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Determine organizer info based on owner_context_type
const isOrganization = data.owner_context_type === 'organization';

const organizerName = isOrganization
  ? data.organizations?.name || 'Organization'      // ‚Üê Use org name
  : data.user_profiles?.display_name || 'Organizer'; // ‚Üê Use user name

const organizerAvatar = isOrganization
  ? data.organizations?.logo_url || ''              // ‚Üê Use org logo
  : data.user_profiles?.photo_url || '';            // ‚Üê Use user photo

const organizerId = isOrganization
  ? data.owner_context_id                           // ‚Üê Use org ID
  : data.created_by;                                // ‚Üê Use user ID
```

### **4. Updated Navigation Logic**

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
<button onClick={() => navigate(`/u/${event.organizer.id}`)}>
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
<button onClick={() => {
  if (event.ownerContextType === 'organization') {
    navigate(`/org/${event.ownerContextId}`);  // ‚Üê Navigate to org profile
  } else {
    navigate(`/u/${event.organizer.id}`);      // ‚Üê Navigate to user profile
  }
}}>
```

## üéØ How It Works Now

### **For User-Hosted Events:**

**Database:**
```
owner_context_type = 'user'
created_by = 'user-123'
```

**Display:**
- Name: User's display_name
- Avatar: User's photo_url
- Click: Navigate to `/u/{userId}`

**Example:**
```
üë§ John Smith
   Event Organizer
```

### **For Organization-Hosted Events:**

**Database:**
```
owner_context_type = 'organization'
owner_context_id = 'org-456'
```

**Display:**
- Name: Organization's name
- Avatar: Organization's logo_url
- Click: Navigate to `/org/{orgId}`

**Example:**
```
üè¢ YardPass Events Inc.
   Event Organizer
```

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

### **User-Hosted Event:**

| Field | Before | After | Change |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Name | User name | User name | ‚úÖ Same |
| Avatar | User photo | User photo | ‚úÖ Same |
| Navigation | `/u/{userId}` | `/u/{userId}` | ‚úÖ Same |

### **Organization-Hosted Event:**

| Field | Before | After | Change |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Name | User name ‚ùå | **Org name** ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Fixed! |
| Avatar | User photo ‚ùå | **Org logo** ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Fixed! |
| Navigation | `/u/{userId}` ‚ùå | **`/org/{orgId}`** ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Fixed! |

## üîÑ Data Flow

### **Database Structure:**

```
events table:
‚îú‚îÄ created_by (user who created it)
‚îú‚îÄ owner_context_type ('user' or 'organization')
‚îî‚îÄ owner_context_id (user ID or org ID)

When owner_context_type = 'user':
  ‚Üí Show created_by user's info
  
When owner_context_type = 'organization':
  ‚Üí Show owner_context_id organization's info
```

### **Query Joins:**

```typescript
// Always fetch both (one will be null)
user_profiles!events_created_by_fkey (...)
organizations!events_owner_context_id_fkey (...)

// Then choose which to display
if (owner_context_type === 'organization') {
  use organizations.name and organizations.logo_url
} else {
  use user_profiles.display_name and user_profiles.photo_url
}
```

## ‚úÖ Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: User Event**
```
Event: "John's Birthday Party"
owner_context_type: 'user'
created_by: 'user-123'

Expected:
- Shows: "John Smith" with user photo
- Clicks to: /u/user-123

Result: ‚úÖ WORKING
```

### **Scenario 2: Organization Event**
```
Event: "YardPass Launch"
owner_context_type: 'organization'  
owner_context_id: 'org-456'

Expected:
- Shows: "YardPass Events Inc." with org logo
- Clicks to: /org/org-456

Result: ‚úÖ WORKING
```

---

## üéØ Why This Matters

### **User Experience:**

**BEFORE:**
```
Event: "YardPass Launch"
Organizer: "Roderick Moodie" ‚ùå (wrong - he just created it)
```
Users would think Roderick is hosting personally, when actually YardPass organization is hosting.

**AFTER:**
```
Event: "YardPass Launch"
Organizer: "YardPass Events Inc." ‚úÖ (correct - the org is hosting)
```
Users correctly see the organization as the host.

### **Brand Visibility:**

- Organizations get proper credit
- Logo displayed (branding)
- Links to org profile (discovery)
- Professional appearance

### **Navigation Accuracy:**

- Click organizer ‚Üí Go to correct profile
- Organizations ‚Üí Org profile page
- Users ‚Üí User profile page
- No confusion or broken links
