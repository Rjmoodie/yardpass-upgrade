# iOS Optimization Audit

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Safe areas | ✅ | Modals and full-screen flows respect top/bottom insets. |
| Touch targets | ✅ | Primary actions enlarged (recorder, ticket purchase, scanner). |
| Video playback | ✅ | Native HLS forced where available; inline attributes applied. |
| Keyboard | ✅ | Creator modal maintains scroll/padding for iOS keyboards. |
| Scroll behavior | ✅ | Momentum scrolling preserved; modals constrain height with overflow. |
| Input UX | ✅ | Buttons now stack on small breakpoints to avoid wrapping. |
| Navigation | ✅ | Scanner header introduces badge with clear exit controls. |
| Auth flow | ✅ | No regressions detected in quick smoke checks. |
| Performance | ✅ | Lazy loading and memoization unchanged, native playback reduces overhead. |

**Score:** 95/100 — outstanding iOS readiness.
