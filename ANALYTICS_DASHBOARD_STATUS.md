## ⚠️ Issues to Address

### Issue 1: Spend Aggregation Discrepancy 🔴

**Symptoms:**
- **Summary Card:** Shows **3.00 credits**
- **Budget Pacing:** Shows **1.50 credits**
- **Database:** Shows **0.50 credits** in `spend_accrual`
- **Chart Tooltip:** Shows **0.5 credits** per day for 3 days

**Likely Cause:**
The materialized view is creating separate rows for each day (Oct 25, 26, 27), and the frontend is summing them when it should be using date filtering or aggregating differently.

**Investigation Needed:**
```sql
-- Run this to see the issue:
SELECT day, spend_credits 
FROM public.analytics_campaign_daily_mv
WHERE campaign_id = '3a51d5c9-b817-4c11-859f-5cd0b4c5b1ec'
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

**Possible Fixes:**
1. Frontend should filter to a specific date range before summing
2. Materialized view might be duplicating spend across days
3. The `spend_accrual` might be included multiple times

### Issue 2: Dwell Time Showing 0ms 🟡

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows **"Avg Dwell: 0 ms"**
- Expected: Should show ~1000-2000ms based on tracking

**Likely Causes:**
1. Early test impressions logged before dwell time tracking was added
2. Frontend not passing `dwellMs` parameter
3. Impressions logged without proper dwell calculation

**Investigation Needed:**
```sql
-- Check if impressions have dwell_ms:
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_impressions,
  AVG(dwell_ms) AS avg_dwell,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE dwell_ms > 0) AS with_dwell
FROM campaigns.ad_impressions
WHERE campaign_id = '3a51d5c9-b817-4c11-859f-5cd0b4c5b1ec';
```

**Fix:**
If dwell_ms is 0, you need to:
1. Generate new test impressions with proper dwell time
2. Clear old test data: `clear-test-impressions.sql`
3. Scroll through feed again to log fresh impressions

### Issue 3: No Attribution Data 🟢 (Expected)

**Symptoms:**
- Attribution Mix shows **"No attribution data available"**

**Status:** This is **CORRECT** behavior because:
- ✅ You have 0 conversions
- ✅ Attribution requires conversions to exist
- ✅ Once you add `trackTicketPurchase()` and complete a purchase, this will populate

**Next Step:**
Add conversion tracking to your checkout flow (see `CONVERSION_TRACKING_INTEGRATION.md`)

## 🎯 Priority Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Spend Aggregation 🔴
**Run this diagnostic:**
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
fix-analytics-aggregation.sql
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Identify if materialized view has duplicate rows
- Understand why spend is being counted 3x or 6x
- Fix frontend aggregation logic if needed

### Priority 2: Verify Dwell Time Tracking 🟡
**Steps:**
1. Clear existing test data:
   ```sql
   -- Run: clear-test-impressions.sql
   ```
2. Generate fresh impressions:
   - Open feed
   - Scroll to promoted ad
   - Watch for **2+ seconds**
   - Check console logs for `dwellMs` value
3. Verify database:
   ```sql
   SELECT dwell_ms FROM campaigns.ad_impressions 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

### Priority 3: Add Conversion Tracking 🟢
**Implementation:**
1. Open your checkout component
2. Add tracking after successful payment:
   ```typescript
   import { trackTicketPurchase, getOrCreateSessionId } from '@/lib/conversionTracking';
   
   await trackTicketPurchase({
     userId: user?.id || null,
     sessionId: getOrCreateSessionId(),
     ticketId: ticket.id,
     priceCents: ticket.price_cents,
     source: 'checkout'
   });
   ```
3. Test with a purchase
4. Verify attribution appears on dashboard
