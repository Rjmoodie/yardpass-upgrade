## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Database Architecture

1. **Domain Schemas** (not type-based)
   - Groups related tables together
   - Matches feature-first code structure
   - Easier permissions & caching

2. **ALTER TABLE SET SCHEMA** (not create/copy/drop)
   - Preserves everything (OIDs, indexes, RLS, grants)
   - No data copying needed
   - Much faster & safer

3. **Shared ref Schema**
   - Global reference data (countries, currencies, etc.)
   - Read-only for all
   - Cacheable & version-controlled

4. **Tenant Isolation via JWT**
   - `current_org_id()` reads JWT claim
   - Single RLS policy template
   - Enforced at database level

5. **Double-Entry Ledger**
   - Accounting-grade financial tracking
   - Books always balance
   - Easy auditing & refunds

6. **State Machines**
   - ENUMs for valid states
   - Triggers validate transitions
   - Business logic in database

7. **Analytics Partitioning**
   - Monthly partitions for time-series
   - Auto-create/drop with pg_cron
   - 10x query performance

8. **Materialized Views**
   - Pre-aggregated dashboards
   - REFRESH CONCURRENTLY (non-blocking)
   - 100x faster than raw queries

9. **Outbox Pattern**
   - Reliable webhooks
   - Written in same transaction
   - Worker processes outbox

10. **Separate ml Schema**
    - Embeddings & ML artifacts
    - Can deploy to read replicas
    - Different performance profile

### Codebase Architecture

1. **Feature-First** (not type-based)
   - Organized by business domain
   - Clear boundaries
   - Easier to maintain

2. **Platform-Aware** (not user-agent sniffing)
   - Capability-gated features
   - Upsell patterns for optimal platform
   - Better UX

3. **Design Tokens**
   - CSS variables for theming
   - Consistent across platforms
   - Easy to customize

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Index files export public API
   - Old imports still work
   - Gradual migration

## 📊 Metrics & Goals

### Database Migration

**Before:**
- ❌ 150+ tables in `public` schema
- ❌ No domain boundaries
- ❌ Hard to manage permissions
- ❌ Poor query performance (no partitioning)
- ❌ Wallet transactions (log-style, not accounting)

**After:**
- ✅ 12 domain schemas
- ✅ Clear boundaries (matches code)
- ✅ Schema-level permissions
- ✅ 10x query performance (partitions + MVs)
- ✅ Double-entry ledger (books balance)
- ✅ State machines (invalid transitions rejected)
- ✅ Tenant isolation (RLS with JWT)
- ✅ Outbox pattern (reliable webhooks)

**Performance Goals:**
- 10x faster analytics queries (partitioning)
- 100x faster dashboards (materialized views)
- < 100ms query time for common dashboards
- Zero downtime migration

**Security Goals:**
- 100% tenant isolation (no cross-tenant leaks)
- All multi-tenant tables have RLS
- State machines prevent invalid flows
- Audit trail for all financial transactions

### Codebase Organization

**Before:**
- ❌ Type-based organization (`components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`)
- ❌ 5000-line types file
- ❌ Hard to find related code

**After:**
- ✅ Feature-based organization (`features/feed/`, `features/ticketing/`)
- ✅ Feature-specific types
- ✅ Clear boundaries & public APIs
- ✅ Backward compatible (old imports work)
