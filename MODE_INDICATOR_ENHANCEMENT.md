# Profile Mode Indicator Enhancement ‚úÖ

## Overview
Added a clear, visible indicator showing whether the user is in "Attendee Mode" or "Organizer Mode" on their profile page.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **Visible Mode Badge** üè∑Ô∏è
Added a prominent badge below the username that displays:
- **"Organizer Mode"** (with orange shield icon) when in organizer mode
- **"Attendee Mode"** (with gray shield icon) when in attendee mode

**Design**:
- Rounded pill shape with subtle border
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- Small shield icon matching the current mode
- Always visible - no hovering required

**Location**: Directly below the editable username on your own profile

### 2. **Enhanced Shield Button Tooltip** üí¨
Updated the shield button (top-right header) with clearer tooltips:
- **Organizer Mode**: "Currently: Organizer Mode - Click to switch to Attendee"
- **Attendee Mode**: "Currently: Attendee Mode - Click to switch to Organizer"

**Previous**: Just said "Switch to Attendee" or "Become Organizer"  
**Now**: Clearly states CURRENT mode + action

### 3. **Accessibility Improvements** ‚ôø
- Added `aria-label` for screen readers
- Clear visual distinction between modes
- High contrast colors for readability

## Visual Design

### Badge Styling
```css
/* Rounded pill with subtle glass effect */
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)
backdrop-filter: blur(8px)
padding: 6px 12px
border-radius: 9999px (full)
```

## User Experience

### Before ‚ùå
1. Shield button in header changed color, but unclear what mode you were in
2. Had to click toggle to see what happened
3. Tooltip only showed the action, not current state

### After ‚úÖ
1. **Visible badge** shows current mode at all times
2. **No clicking needed** to know your mode
3. **Enhanced tooltip** clearly states: "Currently: X Mode - Click to switch to Y"
4. **Visual consistency** - shield icon in both badge and button
