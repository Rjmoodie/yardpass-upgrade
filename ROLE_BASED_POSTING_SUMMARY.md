# Role-Based Post Creation Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully implemented role-based post creation that respects the user's current mode (attendee vs organizer).

### Functionality Changes

#### **Organizer Mode** (`user.role === 'organizer'`)
- ✅ Can post to events where they are **attendees** (have tickets)
- ✅ Can post to events where they are **organizers** (created events or organization members)
- ✅ Shows both types of events in the event selection dropdown
- ✅ Prioritizes organizer status when user has both ticket and organizer access to same event

#### **Attendee Mode** (`user.role === 'attendee'`)
- ✅ Can only post to events where they are **attendees** (have tickets)
- ✅ Does not show organizer events in the selection dropdown
- ✅ Focused experience for attendees only

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **Enhanced Event Fetching Logic**
- Modified the `useEffect` in `PostCreator` component to conditionally fetch organizer events
- Added `user.role` to the dependency array to refetch when role changes
- Implemented proper filtering based on current user mode

#### 2. **Smart Event Combination**
```typescript
// Organizer mode: show both attendee and organizer events
if (user.role === 'organizer') {
  allEvents = [...organizerEventsFormatted, ...ticketEvents];
} else {
  // Attendee mode: only show attendee events
  allEvents = ticketEvents;
}
```

#### 3. **UI Improvements**
- **Dynamic Placeholder Text**: 
  - Organizer mode: "Select an event to post to"
  - Attendee mode: "Select an event you're attending"
- **Contextual Help Text**:
  - Organizer mode: "Post to events you're attending or organizing"
  - Attendee mode: "Post to events you're attending"

#### 4. **Badge System**
- Events where user is organizer show "ORGANIZER" badge
- Events where user has tickets show their ticket tier badge (VIP, GA, etc.)
- When user has both access types to same event, organizer status takes priority

### Database Queries

#### Attendee Events (Always Fetched)
- Queries `tickets` table for user's valid tickets
- Includes ticket tier information and badge labels

#### Organizer Events (Only in Organizer Mode)
- Queries `events` table for events created by user
- Queries `org_memberships` for organization roles (owner, admin, editor)
- Queries `events` table for organization-owned events where user has posting rights

### Benefits

1. **Clear Role Separation**: Users see only relevant events based on their current mode
2. **Flexible Access**: Organizers can post to events they attend AND organize
3. **Intuitive UI**: Clear indicators of what events are available and why
4. **Secure**: Respects existing database permissions and RLS policies
5. **Performance**: Only fetches organizer data when needed (organizer mode)

## Testing Scenarios

- ✅ Attendee mode shows only events with tickets
- ✅ Organizer mode shows both ticket events and organized events  
- ✅ Events are properly deduplicated with organizer status prioritized
- ✅ UI updates when switching between modes
- ✅ Proper badge display for different access types
