## 1. User Roles & Authentication

### Authentication

### Roles
- **Attendee** (default): browse events, interact with posts, buy tickets.  
- **Organizer**: can create/manage events, dashboards, analytics.  
- **Role Toggle**: users can switch between attendee view and organizer view with a toggle.

## 4. Content & Engagement

- **Video-First Feed** (powered by MUX or similar):  
  - Event-related posts (short-form video).  
  - Interactions: like, comment, share.  
  - Redirect buttons: to event, to organizer, or to user profile.  

- **Posting Rules**:  
  - Anyone can post to an event feed.  
  - Attendees get a **badge** showing ticket tier next to their username.  

- **Attendee Profile**:  
  - Past & future ticket catalogue.  
  - TikTok-style profile feed of posts tied to events attended.

## 5. Badge System

- Event-specific badges (not global).  
- Badge tied to **ticket tier**.  
- Example: “VIP”, “Early Bird”, “General”.  
- Stored in DB (event_attendee_tiers table) → easier for queries.  

---

## 6. Verification

- **User Verification**:  
  - Phone verification (mandatory).  
  - 2FA recommended for organizers.  

- **Organization Verification**:  
  - Stripe Connect onboarding (for payouts).  
  - Business docs check.  

- **Verification Levels**:  
  - none → pending → verified → pro (after 25 events completed).  

---

## 7. Payments & Payouts

- **Stripe Connect** for payouts (organizer onboarding required).  
- **Take Rate**:  
  - Platform fee modeled after Eventbrite: ~3.7% + $1.79 per ticket.  
  - Weighted average % tracked as "platform fee as % GMV".  
- **Refunds**: Configurable by organizers (default: 7 days before event).  

---

## 8. Analytics

- **Organizer Analytics**:  
  - Ticket sales, revenue, refunds.  
  - Engagement data (views, shares, comments).  
  - Affiliate/promoter tracking (via share links).  

- **Attendee Analytics**:  
  - Past tickets, attended events, badges earned.

- **SMS & Email Marketing**: integrated into organizer dashboard.  
- **Scanner Role**: assigned per event for door check-in.  
- **Privacy & Legal**: privacy policy, terms of service, refund policy pages required.  

---

## 10. Growth & Tiering

- **Free entry** for all creators → encourages more events.  
- **Tier 1 tools**: unlocked with phone + 2FA.  
- **Tier 2 tools**: unlocked for organizations after business verification & 25 completed events.  
- Badge upgrade: "Verified Pro".
